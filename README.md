# Cloud Computing Mini-Project: CV Builder Website Deployment on AWS EC2 Instance

## Project Overview
This mini-project is designed for the Cloud Computing subject, focusing on deploying a simple CV Builder website on an AWS EC2 instance. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with cloud infrastructure and deployment processes.

### Project Features
1. **CV Builder Website**: Create a basic CV Builder website where users can input their details and generate a formatted CV.
2. **AWS EC2 Instance**: Deploy the CV Builder on an AWS EC2 instance, utilizing the scalability and flexibility of cloud computing.
3. **Hands-on Learning**: Gain practical knowledge of setting up a web application in a cloud environment.

## Adventure Plan

### 1. Set Up Your AWS Cloud Environment

- Navigate to the EC2 service.
- Create a new EC2 instance for hosting your CV Builder website.

### 2. Configure Your EC2 Instance
- Connect to your EC2 instance using SSH.
- Install necessary dependencies (e.g., web server, database if needed).
- Upload your CV Builder website files.

### 3. Secure Your EC2 Instance
- Implement security best practices for your EC2 instance.
- Set up security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic.

### 4. Launch Your CV Builder Website
- Start the web server on your EC2 instance.
- Access your CV Builder website through the public IP or domain assigned to the EC2 instance.

### 5. Test and Tweak
- Test the functionality of your CV Builder website.
- Tweak configurations as needed for optimal performance.

## Deleting Your AWS Resources
